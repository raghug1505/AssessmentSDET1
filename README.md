# Project Title

Provide a brief description of your project here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them:

- **Java JDK 1.8 or higher** - [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Community or Ultimate edition) - [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- **Maven** (usually bundled with IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepositorylink.com
   ```
2. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**.
3. From the welcome screen or the `File` menu, select `Open` or `Import Project`.
4. **Navigate to the directory** where you cloned the project and select the project directory. Click `OK`.
5. **IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect the Maven project** and attempt to load it. If IntelliJ does not automatically recognize it as a Maven project, follow these steps to enable Maven:
   - Open `File` > `Project Structure` > `Modules`.
   - Click the `+` button, select `Import Module`, and navigate to the project directory.
   - Select the `pom.xml` file and click `OK`.
6. **After the project is opened**, IntelliJ will start importing the Maven dependencies automatically. This might take some time depending on the number of dependencies and your internet speed. You can see the progress at the bottom of the window.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

### Running tests via IntelliJ IDEA

1. In the Project view, **navigate to the `src/test/java` directory**.
2. To run a specific test, **right-click on the test file** (e.g., `CurrencyApiResultValidationTest.java`) and select `Run 'CurrencyApiResultValidationTest'`.
3. To run all tests in a package, **right-click on the package directory** and choose `Run 'Tests in <package name>'`.

### Running tests via command line

You can also run tests from the command line using Maven:

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run a single test class
mvn -Dtest=CurrencyApiResultValidationTest test

# Run multiple specific tests
mvn -Dtest=TestOne,TestTwo test
```

## Understanding Test Results

- After running the tests, **IntelliJ IDEA will display the results** in the Run window.
- A green bar indicates successful tests without any failures. A red bar indicates there are test failures, and you can click on each failed test to view the error details and stack trace.
